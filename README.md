## Progress Check-up

I made a tasklist for everytime I worked on this project. The goal of it was to track my progress as I learn more concepts and apply them to make a fleshed out project. 
- - 
These are my check-ins:

- (10/18) Code for the canvas itself
    1. create a 16x16 grid 
    2. add .grid-square as child of .grid
    3. onmousedown -> background-color of .grid-square = black

- (10/19) Added buttons
    1. show-grid - .toggle the gap on grid
    2. erase - background-color of .grid-square = background
    3. add theme for toggled button / hover
    4. polish css
